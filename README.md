# Advanced NLP Repository

This repository contains advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) implementations built from scratch, focusing on core algorithms and model architectures.

## Overview
The goal of this repository is to deeply understand NLP fundamentals by implementing key models without relying heavily on high-level libraries.

## Topics Covered
- **Word2Vec**
  - CBOW (Continuous Bag of Words)
  - Skip-gram
  - Negative Sampling
  - Training word embeddings from raw text

- **Dependency Parsing**
  - Syntactic dependency trees
  - Transition-based parsing
  - Feature extraction and parsing algorithms

- **Transformers (From Scratch)**
  - Self-attention mechanism
  - Multi-head attention
  - Positional encoding
  - Encoder and decoder architecture
  - Training and inference pipelines
